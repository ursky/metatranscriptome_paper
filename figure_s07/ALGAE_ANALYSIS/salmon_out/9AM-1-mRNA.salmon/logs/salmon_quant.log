[2018-12-07 11:24:03.047] [jointLog] [info] Computed 50195 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-12-07 11:24:03.047] [jointLog] [info] Counted 302145 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-12-07 11:24:03.070] [jointLog] [warning] 1.37951% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2018-12-07 11:24:03.347] [jointLog] [warning] Only 302145 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
