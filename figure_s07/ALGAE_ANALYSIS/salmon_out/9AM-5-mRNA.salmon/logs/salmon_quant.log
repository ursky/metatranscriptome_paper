[2018-12-07 11:23:55.713] [jointLog] [info] Counted 273238 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-12-07 11:23:55.732] [jointLog] [warning] 0.116511% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2018-12-07 11:23:55.867] [jointLog] [warning] Only 273238 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
