[2018-12-07 11:24:00.801] [jointLog] [info] Counted 239246 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-12-07 11:24:00.832] [jointLog] [warning] 0.0845253% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2018-12-07 11:24:01.041] [jointLog] [warning] Only 239246 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
