[2018-12-07 11:24:00.908] [jointLog] [warning] 0.43413% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.

==================
Observed 918389 total fragments (918389 in most recent round)

[2018-12-07 11:24:01.114] [jointLog] [warning] Only 313676 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
